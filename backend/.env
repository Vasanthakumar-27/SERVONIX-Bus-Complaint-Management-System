# ⚠️  RENDER DEPLOYMENT: Gmail SMTP (port 587) is often BLOCKED by cloud hosts.
# If OTPs are not arriving, use Resend instead:
#   1. Sign up free at https://resend.com
#   2. Add + verify a sending domain (or use any address with a verified domain)
#   3. Create an API key and paste it below:
# RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# RESEND_FROM=SERVONIX <noreply@yourdomain.com>
#
# ⚠️  Do NOT use onboarding@resend.dev as RESEND_FROM in production —
#     that sandbox address only delivers to the Resend account owner's email.

# Debug endpoints (use /debug/email-status and /debug/email-test)

# To generate Gmail App Password:
